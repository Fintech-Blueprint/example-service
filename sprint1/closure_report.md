**Date**: September 25, 2025
**Status**: Completed
**Branch**: phase4/sprint1-init

## 1. Deliverables Status

### 1.1 Core Requirements
✅ **Service-a POC Implementation**
- Base service deployed and operational
- Sandbox compliance mode active
- Monitoring endpoints configured
- Health checks operational

✅ **Orchestrator Skeleton**
- Basic promotion workflow implemented
- Evidence collection points defined
- Single-service POC mode configured
- Stub implementations ready for Sprint 2 extensions

✅ **Evidence Chain Implementation (Stub)**
- Basic hash chain structure implemented
- POC evidence collection operational
- Ready for WORM storage integration in Sprint 2

✅ **Monitoring & Dashboards**
- Grafana dashboards deployed
- Base metrics collection active
- Alert thresholds configured
- Ready for KPI extensions

### 1.2 Known Gaps (Sprint 2 Scope)

1. **Service Mesh Implementation**
   - Current Status: Pending
   - Sprint 2 Action: Enforce mTLS and RBAC

2. **Multi-Service Orchestration**
   - Current Status: Single-service POC only
   - Sprint 2 Action: Implement parallel promotion capability

3. **Evidence Chain Enhancement**
   - Current Status: Basic hash chain only
   - Sprint 2 Action: Integrate WORM storage

4. **Service-c Onboarding**
   - Current Status: Not started
   - Sprint 2 Action: Complete template and onboarding

## 2. Environment Status

### 2.1 Authentication
- GitHub: Dev14-ai account active and configured
- Vault: Token validated and operational
- Required tools installed and verified

### 2.2 Infrastructure
- Kubernetes namespace ready for service mesh
- Vault paths configured for secret management
- Monitoring infrastructure operational

## 3. Sprint 2 Readiness

✅ **Prerequisites Met**
- Base infrastructure operational
- Service-a POC validated
- Evidence collection framework ready
- Monitoring baseline established

⏳ **Pending Actions**
1. Mesh configuration and enforcement
2. WORM storage integration
3. Parallel promotion implementation
4. Service-c onboarding
5. Dashboard KPI extensions

## 4. Recommendations

1. Proceed with Sprint 2 kickoff
2. Prioritize mesh enforcement as blocking requirement
3. Implement WORM storage early to validate evidence chain
4. Complete service-c onboarding after mesh stability

Sprint 1 objectives have been met with known gaps properly scoped for Sprint 2 implementation.
