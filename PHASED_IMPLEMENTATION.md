## Potential Gray Zones & Mitigation

### 1. Mode Transition vs Load Testing
**Gray Zone:** Running load tests during mode transitions could produce inconsistent results
**Mitigation:**
- Add mode-aware load test configurations
- Implement test timing controls
- Document transition blackout periods

### 2. Rollback vs Compliance
**Gray Zone:** Rolling back could break compliance state
**Mitigation:**
- Store compliance evidence with snapshots
- Add compliance validation to rollback process
- Implement staged rollback

### 3. Metrics vs Performance
**Gray Zone:** Excessive metrics collection could impact service performance
**Mitigation:**
- Add metric sampling controls
- Implement metric aggregation
- Configure retention policies

### 4. Security Scans vs CI Time
**Gray Zone:** Comprehensive security scanning could slow CI/CD
**Mitigation:**
- Parallel security scan jobs
- Cached scan results
- Risk-based scan levels

### 5. Backup vs SBOM
**Gray Zone:** Large SBOM data could impact backup performance
**Mitigation:**
- Separate SBOM archival
- Incremental SBOM updates
- Optimized storage format

## Implementation Guidelines

### Service Mode Transitions
1. Block transitions during:
   - Load testing
   - Backup operations
   - Security scans

2. Require for transitions:
   - Clean security scan
   - Valid SBOM
   - Passing load tests

### Monitoring
1. Metric Collection:
   - Use sampling for high-volume metrics
   - Aggregate historical data
   - Implement metric priority levels

2. Alert Configuration:
   - Mode-aware thresholds
   - Gradual threshold adjustment
   - Alert correlation rules

### Security Operations
1. Scan Scheduling:
   - Run full scans off-peak
   - Use incremental scans
   - Cache scan results

2. Evidence Collection:
   - Structured evidence format
   - Automated collection
   - Retention policy enforcement
