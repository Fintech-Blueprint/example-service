What I tried

- Downloaded the workflow run object via the Actions API.
- Attempted to list jobs and download the run logs archive.

What I found

- The run exists and its conclusion is `failure`.
- The Actions API reports **0 jobs** for this run (the `/jobs` endpoint returned an empty list).
- Because there are no jobs recorded for the run, the logs archive endpoint returns 404 (no logs available).

Implication

- There are no per-job logs to extract for this run, so I cannot provide failed job names, failed step names, or error-line snippets for `17750378058`.
- A run with no jobs typically indicates the workflow could not start its jobs. Possible reasons include:
  - Workflow parsing or validation error during the run bootstrap.
  - Required workflow inputs/secrets or permissions prevented jobs from being scheduled.
  - An organization or repository Actions policy prevented the run from starting jobs.
  - The workflow executed but all jobs were skipped due to `if:` conditions evaluating to false.

Recommended triage steps

1. Open the run details page in the Actions UI and inspect the top-level run message and any visible annotations:

   $BROWSER https://github.com/Fintech-Blueprint/example-service/actions/runs/17750378058

2. Check the repository's Actions settings (Settings → Actions):
   - Verify Actions is enabled for this repository.
   - Verify `Workflow permissions` allow the actor to run workflows (set to Read and write if required).
   - If your org has policies restricting which workflows can run, verify the policy allows this run.

3. On the run page, if the workflow was rejected or had a syntax/validation error, GitHub often shows an error message at the top — capture that message.

4. Confirm the workflow file on `main` is the corrected one (it was updated programmatically). You can view the file:

   https://github.com/Fintech-Blueprint/example-service/blob/main/.github/workflows/ci.yml

5. If the run page shows jobs were skipped due to `if:` conditions, review those conditions in the workflow and the event payload.

6. If no UI details explain it, collect Actions audit logs and organization-level logs (Organization → Settings → Audit log) or contact GitHub Support with the run ID.

7. After addressing the root cause, re-run the workflow (there's a "Re-run jobs" or "Re-run workflow" button on the Actions run page) or push another empty commit to retrigger.

If you want, I can:

- Attempt a follow-up API check for check-runs or annotations on the associated commit SHA.
- Tail the repository-level Actions audit logs (if you provide access) to find policy rejections.
- Re-run the unblock+merge flow after you confirm the next CI run has jobs and passes.
