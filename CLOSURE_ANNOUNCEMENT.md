Closure announcement â€” Secret exposure incident

Date: 2025-09-23
Repository: Fintech-Blueprint/example-service

Summary:
- CEO/CTO approved a final, non-destructive closure regarding a secret exposure incident that occurred on 2025-09-23.
- The incident involved a personal access token (PAT) displayed in a terminal and used to trigger a `lint.yml` workflow. The token was not found in committed files; placeholder examples exist in `README.md` and `infra/vault/check_adoption.sh`.

Actions taken:
- Audit performed and artifacts produced (`session_log.md`, `repo_audit.md`, `archive_plan.md`).
- Archive of artifacts created at `secure/artifacts/secret-exposure-2025-09-23.tar.gz` with checksum `secure/artifacts/secret-exposure-2025-09-23.sha256`.
- Programmatic download of Actions run artifacts returned none; full run logs are available in GitHub Actions UI.
- Per CEO instruction, the untracked PEM in `secure/vault-uploads/` is retained.

Next steps & contacts:
- Revoke the exposed PAT (if not already done) and rotate any affected secrets. Security team: @security-team
- For audit access to the archive, contact: security@example.com
- If a history-rewrite is later approved, the security team will coordinate a freeze window and verification steps.

This announcement is published internally and should not be shared publicly.
