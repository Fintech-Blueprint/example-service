## Verification Results

| Component | Status | Validation Method |
|-----------|--------|------------------|
| Resource Validation | ✅ | JSON schema verification |
| Branch Naming | ✅ | Git branch inspection |
| Reports Structure | ✅ | Directory structure check |
| SBOM Generation | ✅ | CycloneDX validation |
| Signature System | ✅ | Cosign verification |
| Deployment Config | ✅ | Manifest validation |
| Audit Trail | ✅ | Checkpoint verification |
| Mode Behaviors | ✅ | Configuration check |

## Next Steps

1. Monitor system performance:
   - Track deployment success rates
   - Analyze retry patterns
   - Monitor resource usage

2. Security enhancements:
   - Implement regular secret rotation
