  Memory: 128-512 MB
  
  # Compliance Mode (future)
  CPU: 0.1-16.0 cores
  Memory: 128-32768 MB
  Storage: 10-100000 MB
  Story Points: 1-20 (integers only)
  ```
- Mode-specific behaviors operational:
  - Sandbox: Collects warnings, continues execution
  - Compliance: Strict validation, fails fast
- Resource tracking active with Prometheus integration

✅ **Feature Identification**
- SHA256-based identification (12-char) implemented
- Current feature SHA: `005cc0262265`
- Branch naming convention enforced: `auto/spec-implementation/<sha>`

  - Compliance mode: Blocks on conflict
  - Sandbox mode: Creates `-v2` variants

## 3. Deployment & Pipeline

### CI/CD Pipeline
✅ **Stage Implementation**
1. Preflight (Spec Validation)
2. Validate (Lint & Test)
3. Generate (Code Generation)
4. Build (Container Image)
5. Deploy (Staging)
6. Audit (Reports)

✅ **Resource Controls**
- CPU: Limited to 0.1-0.5 cores
- Memory: Capped at 128Mi-512Mi
- Health monitoring: Active

### Deployment Strategy
✅ **Standardized Retry Mechanism**
- Unified across all pipeline stages:
  - 2 retry attempts
  - 120s intervals
  - Full traceability in reports
- Automatic rollback on failure
- Health check endpoint: `/healthz`
- Comprehensive retry logging

## 4. Audit & Compliance

### Audit Trail
✅ **Checkpoint System**
- ISO timestamp format
- Run ID tracking
- Feature SHA association
- Full artifact referencing

Sample checkpoint entry:
```
2025-09-24T14:04:40Z | 20250924140440 | 005cc0262265 | preflight | success | spec-validation-report.json
```

### Compliance Features
✅ **Mode-Specific Controls**
- Sandbox Mode (Current):
  - Flexible validation (0.1-0.5 CPU cores)
  - Auto-fix for minor issues (lint, format, whitespace)
  - Branch variants up to -v5
  - Quick iteration support
  - Resource metrics collection without enforcement

- Compliance Mode (Future):
  - Strict validation (0.1-16.0 CPU cores)
  - No auto-fixes
  - Blocks on branch conflicts
  - Required security checks
  - Manual approval workflow
  - Full audit trail
  - Resource limit enforcement
