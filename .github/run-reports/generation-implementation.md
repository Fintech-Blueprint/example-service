# Generator Implementation Report

## Implementation Details

### 1. Generator Enhancements
- Added deterministic headers with spec SHA
- Implemented idempotent file generation
- Added manifest generation with checksums
- Added atomic file writing for safety

### 2. Test Coverage
Created `tests/generator/test_generator.py` with tests for:
- SHA computation
- Header generation
- Atomic file writing
- Idempotency
- Full generation process

### 3. Auto-Generate Workflow
Created `.github/workflows/auto-generate.yml` that:
- Triggers on feature file changes
- Chains after validate-specs workflow
- Creates PRs with complete documentation
- Includes compliance checklist

### 4. Initial Generation Results

```json
{
  "spec_sha": "$(cat generated/manifest.json | jq -r .spec_sha)",
  "generated_files": $(cat reports/generated_files.json | jq -c),
  "coverage": $(cat reports/spec-coverage.json | jq -c)
}
```

### 5. Next Steps
1. Review and merge generator implementation
2. Monitor auto-generate workflow execution
3. Update remaining feature files to pass validation
4. Implement additional resource metrics
