# Analysis of CTO Instructions - Contradictions and Gray Zones

## 1. Identified Contradictions

### Resource Limits
**Contradiction**: Two different sets of CPU ranges mentioned
- Original report: `CPU: 0.1-16.0 (3 decimal places)`
- New instructions: `CPU 0.1-0.5` in build stage
- **Impact**: Need clarification on which range to enforce

### Retry Mechanisms
**Contradiction**: Different retry configurations specified
- Original: "2 retry attempts, 120s intervals"
- New instructions: "Retry x2, 120s interval" but smoke tests use "3 attempts, 2s delay"
- **Impact**: Need to standardize retry patterns across different components

### Report Retention
**Contradiction**: Different retention policies
- Original: Using date-based YYYYMMDD archival
- New instructions: "Last 20 runs retained; older runs by date"
- **Impact**: Need to reconcile retention policies

## 2. Gray Zones Requiring Clarification

### Auto-Fix Boundaries
- What constitutes a "minor" style issue?
- No clear criteria for auto-fix vs. manual review
- Risk of auto-fixes causing unintended side effects

### Conflict Resolution
**Gray Area**: Branch naming with -v2 through -v5
- When to stop creating variants?
- What happens after v5 is reached?
- Criteria for choosing between variants

### Monitoring Thresholds
- No specific thresholds for health_up state changes
- No defined alerting criteria
- Unclear monitoring retention period

### Security Transition
**Gray Area**: Sandbox to Compliance Mode transition
- When and how to transition?
- Can some components be in compliance while others in sandbox?
- Gradual vs. immediate transition strategy

## 3. Recommended Clarifications Needed

1. **Resource Limits**
   - Standardize CPU range across all documentation
   - Clarify if ranges are environment-specific

2. **Retry Strategy**
   - Define unified retry pattern
   - Specify environment-specific retry policies if needed

3. **Report Management**
   - Clear retention policy combining run count and dates
   - Specify archival trigger conditions

4. **Auto-Fix Scope**
   - Define specific auto-fixable issues
   - Document auto-fix limits and exclusions

5. **Version Control**
   - Maximum number of -vN variants
   - Conflict resolution after max variants reached

6. **Monitoring Framework**
   - Define specific health check thresholds
   - Set alerting criteria
   - Specify metric retention periods

## 4. Current Implementation Status vs. New Requirements

### Aligned Areas
✅ SHA256-based branching
✅ Basic health monitoring
✅ Report generation (JSON + one-line)
✅ Resource tracking
✅ Prometheus integration

### Areas Needing Adjustment
⚠️ Retry mechanism standardization
⚠️ Report retention policy
⚠️ CPU resource limits
⚠️ Auto-fix implementation
⚠️ Conflict resolution strategy

## 5. Recommendations

1. **Immediate Actions**
   - Standardize retry patterns across all components
   - Implement clear auto-fix criteria
   - Define unified resource limits

2. **Documentation Updates**
   - Create decision matrix for auto-fix vs. manual review
   - Document branch conflict resolution workflow
   - Update resource limits in all documentation

3. **Technical Implementation**
   - Implement configurable retry patterns
   - Add auto-fix logging and limits
   - Update resource constraints

4. **Monitoring Enhancements**
   - Define clear health check criteria
   - Implement metric thresholds
   - Add alerting rules

## 6. Risk Assessment

### High Risk Areas
1. Auto-fix without clear boundaries
2. Undefined conflict resolution limits
3. Inconsistent retry patterns

### Mitigation Strategies
1. Implement strict auto-fix logging
2. Add conflict resolution monitoring
3. Standardize retry configurations
