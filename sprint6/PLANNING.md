# Sprint 6 Planning Document
**Date:** September 26, 2025
**Status:** Draft
**Previous:** Sprint 5 (Resilience & Observability)

## Lessons Learned from Sprint 5

### 1. Canary Automation
- Consider implementing more granular steps (e.g., 90/10 → 75/25 → 50/50)
- Add business metrics validation
- Implement automated smoke tests at each step
- Add configurable wait times between steps

### 2. Chaos Testing
- Expand scenarios to include multi-pod failures
- Add network partition tests
- Implement degraded-mode testing
- Consider adding database chaos testing

### 3. Metrics & Monitoring
- Add custom business metrics
- Implement metric retention policies
- Consider metric aggregation for long-term storage
- Add SLO/SLA tracking

## Proposed Sprint 6 Focus Areas

### 1. Multi-Cluster Support
- Cross-cluster service discovery
- Multi-cluster traffic management
- Federated metrics collection
- Disaster recovery scenarios

### 2. Production Alerting
- Alert aggregation and deduplication
- On-call rotation integration
- Runbook automation
- Alert severity classification

### 3. WORM Storage
- Evidence immutability
- Compliance requirements
- Retention policies
- Audit trail enhancement

### 4. Enhancement Proposals
1. Implement metric persistence with long-term storage
2. Add automated performance regression detection
3. Enhance rollback decision making
4. Implement cross-cluster failover

## Technical Requirements

### 1. Infrastructure
- Multi-cluster Kubernetes setup
- Long-term storage solution
