When generating or editing files under `.github/workflows/` follow these rules:

- YAML must be valid and parse without errors.
- Use 2 spaces for indentation per level (no tabs).
- Each job must be a mapping with `runs-on` and `steps` keys.
- Each `steps:` entry must be a list item starting with `- name:` or `- uses:` and contain exactly one of `run:` or `uses:`.
- Do NOT nest `- name:` under a `run:` block.
- Do NOT define `run:` twice in the same step.
- Avoid trailing `\n` escape sequences inside scalar values.
- Prefer using block scalars (`|`) for multi-line `run:` commands.
- Always validate generated YAML with `yamllint` and the GitHub Actions schema before committing.

Examples:

Correct step list example:

  steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v3

    - name: Generate SBOM
      run: |
        pip install cyclonedx-bom
        cyclonedx-py -o sbom.xml

    - name: Sign image (cosign)
      run: |
        echo "placeholder for cosign signing"
        # additional commands

If generating workflows programmatically, ensure the serialization preserves list structure and block scalars exactly as above.
