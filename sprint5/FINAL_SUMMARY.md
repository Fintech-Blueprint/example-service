# Sprint 5 Final Summary - Resilience & Reliability
**Date:** September 26, 2025
**Branch:** phase4/sprint5-resilience/4f798229

## Overview

This sprint focused on proving the resilience and reliability of our service mesh through:
1. Fault injection and chaos testing
2. Progressive canary deployments
3. Advanced observability
4. Persistent monitoring storage
5. Extended evidence chain

## Implementation Details

### 1. Fault Injection & Chaos Testing
- Implemented Istio fault injection:
  - 2s delay (10% of requests)
  - HTTP 503 errors (5% of requests)
  - Network latency simulation (100ms)
  - Pod kill tests
- Retry policies and circuit breaking configured

### 2. Progressive Canary
- Automated promotion workflow:
  - 90/10 → 50/50 → 100/0
- Success criteria:
  - Error rate ≤ 1%
  - P95 latency ≤ baseline × 1.2
- Automated rollback on threshold breach

### 3. Advanced Observability
- Golden signals dashboard implemented:
  - Latency (P95)
  - Error rate
  - Traffic (RPS)
  - Resource saturation
  - Service health
  - Canary progress
- Alert rules for SLO thresholds

### 4. Persistent Storage
- Prometheus configured with PVC:
  - Size: 10Gi
  - Storage class: standard
  - Retention: 15 days
- Evidence preserved between restarts

### 5. Evidence Chain
- Extended with new artifacts:
  - Fault injection outcomes
  - Chaos test results
  - Canary promotion logs
  - Golden signals dashboard
  - Alert configurations

## Thresholds & Validation

### Error Rate
- Critical threshold: 1%
- Monitoring window: 5m
- Alert severity: Critical

### Latency
- Warning threshold: P95 > baseline × 1.2
- Monitoring window: 5m
- Alert severity: Warning

### Health
- Critical threshold: health_up == 0
- Monitoring window: 1m
- Alert severity: Critical

## Production Recommendations

1. **Storage**
   - Increase PVC size to 50Gi for production
   - Use a production-grade storage class
   - Implement backup strategy

2. **Reliability**
   - Add node anti-affinity rules
   - Implement pod disruption budgets
   - Configure horizontal pod autoscaling

3. **Monitoring**
   - Add more granular SLOs
   - Implement alert aggregation
   - Set up on-call rotation

4. **Canary Deployments**
   - Add more validation steps
   - Implement automated smoke tests
   - Add business metrics validation

## Evidence Chain Status
- All artifacts hashed and tracked
- Full audit trail maintained
- Reproducible test results
- Automated evidence collection

## Go/No-Go Status for Production
✅ **GO** - System demonstrates required resilience:
- Recovers from injected faults
- Handles progressive traffic shifts
- Maintains SLOs under stress
- Preserves evidence chain
- Auto-rollback on threshold breach
