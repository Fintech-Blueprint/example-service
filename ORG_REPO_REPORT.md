   - example-service shows most recent activity (Sept 23, 2025)
   - test_public hasn't been updated since Sept 13, 2025

3. **Technology Stack:**
   - Python is the dominant language
   - Several infrastructure repositories have no primary language specified

## Recommendations

1. **Security:**
   - Review PUBLIC visibility status of all repositories
   - Consider making test repositories private
   - Add descriptions to all repositories

2. **Documentation:**
   - Add meaningful descriptions to all repositories
   - Ensure README files are present and up-to-date

3. **Maintenance:**
   - Review status of test repositories
   - Consider archiving unused test repositories
   - Implement standardized repository templates

## Next Steps

1. Review repository visibility settings
2. Add descriptive information to repositories
3. Establish organization-wide repository standards
